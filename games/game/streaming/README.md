# Let's encourage ad blocking

**[Are you protected against ads?](https://blockads.fivefilters.org)**

The purpose of this project is to test for and encourage the use of ad blockers. 

It's a simple test to see if you have an ad blocker installed, and a recommendation to install one if you don't. We do not believe in '[acceptable advertising](https://github.com/fivefilters/block-ads/wiki/There-are-no-acceptable-ads)' so we also try to test for that and suggest a better adblocker if we detect it. 

The intention is to have a page you can send to family and friends. When they access it, they will get a recommendation for an ad blocker that will run on their browser or device.

We recommend **[uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock)** for Firefox, Chrome, Opera or Microsoft Edge.

We recommend **[Better Blocker](https://better.fyi)** for iOS and Safari.

<!-- See our [Block Ads! update](http://blog.fivefilters.org/post/149982581337/block-ads-update) for information on what we look for in an ad blocker. -->

### Try it!

The code here is running on our site at: [blockads.fivefilters.org](https://blockads.fivefilters.org)

Feel free to share that page with anyone you feel could benefit from more ad blocking.
